Locanote is a next-generation collaborative workspace built for absolute privacy and seamless teamwork. By combining **Local-First architecture**, **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) synchronization**, and **Zero-Knowledge Security**, we've created a platform where you own your data, and no one else can see it—not even us.

## ✨ Features Built for the Modern Era

### 🎙️ AI-Enhanced Accessibility (100% Offline)
- **Edge AI Voice-to-Text**: Dictate your thoughts hands-free. Powered by **OpenAI Whisper**, the AI runs entirely in your browser. No voice data ever leaves your device.
- **Generative UI (GenUI)**: The interface morphs based on your intent. If you're writing a recipe, Chef Mode activates; if you're coding, the environment cools into a developer portal.
- **"Clean Mode"**: A distraction-free toggle that hides technical metadata, giving you a minimal canvas for pure focus.

### 📡 Teamwork Without Boundaries
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Edit with others instantly via **WebRTC**. No central server, no lag, just instant sync.
- **Offline-First**: Keep working in the subway or a plane. Locanote automatically syncs your changes the moment you're back online.
- **Shared Element Transitions**: A fluid, cinematic interface where note cards physically morph into the editor for a "Portal" experience.

### 🔒 Unbreakable Privacy
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Every note is locked with a unique XSalsa20-Poly1305 key that stays on your hardware.
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Our signaling infrastructure is blind to your content. We don't have your keys, so we can't read your notes.
- **Secure Multi-Format Export**: Save your work anytime as Markdown, HTML, or high-fidelity PDF.

## 🎨 Choose Your Aesthetic

Locanote features a high-performance visual engine with four professionally crafted themes:
- **Nebula**: Reactive, fluid mesh gradients that follow your interaction.
- **Crystalline**: High-refraction, geometric shards for a sharp, modern look.
- **Aura**: Soft, slowly moving color clouds (optimized for low-power devices).
- **Glass**: Elegant transparency and depth inspired by modern OS designs.
